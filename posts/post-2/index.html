  <p>Though the Swedish painter Hilma af Klint was unknown to a large part of the world during her lifetime, today she is regarded with artists such as Wassily Kandinsky, Piet Mondrian, and Kazimir Malevich. Hilma af Klint was born in 1862 in Solna, Sweden, and created a total of around 1000 paintings, sketches, and watercolors up to her death in 1944. It was only recently that the Swedish artist, a daughter from a noble house, began to receive more attention for her artistic work. Below are seven interesting facts about this exceptional artist of her time. Link: https://www.thecollector.com/hilma-af-klint-abstract-art/</p>
